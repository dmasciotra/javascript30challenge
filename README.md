# javascript30challenge
My adventure with Wes Boss' JavaScript 30 challenge (https://javascript30.com/)!

## Context

I decided to try out Wes' course as a way to get myself back into JavaScript. It had been years since I last touched it. The course seemed to offer a nice variety of challenges that would touch on different browser apis, and it really seemed like a great way to get my hands dirty with some JavaScript mini-projects.

## The way I approached it

You'll see in all the challenges either a index-START.html and index-FINISHED.html or a scripts-START.js and scripts-FINISHED.js. This is because the way I approached was by copying the files from Wes' source repo, which includes both the START and FINISHED files. I then created a copy of the given START file of the challenge and removed the START suffix. For example, I would copy index-START.html to index.html and work in that file.

I would follow Wes' associated video trainings for the challenges, often times pausing them while attempting to solve them on my own. 

## What I got out of it
By the end, I thought the 30 day challenge was great way to get myself back into JavaScrupt. It was informative, clear, and best of all, FUN. I highly encourage everyone to give it a go, especially if you're just getting into (or back into :)) JavaScript.
Wes is a great teacher!!!
