    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);


    // let name = "Dino";
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // name = "Dinobot";
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const team = players;
    // console.log(team, players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // players.push('Dino');
    // console.log(team, players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let copyBySplice = players.slice();
    console.log(players, copyBySplice);
    copyBySplice.push('Dino');
    console.log(players, copyBySplice);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let copyByNewArray = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, copyByNewArray);
    copyByNewArray.push('Dino');
    console.log(players, copyByNewArray);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let copyBySpread = new Array(...players)
    console.log(players, copyBySpread);
    copyBySpread.push('Dino');
    console.log(players, copyBySpread);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let copy = {};
    Object.assign(copy, person, {age: 99});

    console.log(person, copy);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
